# The 8-bit Catalog

<br>

The 8-bit Catalog is a searchable library of games released for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The React framework Next.js is used for both frontend and backend. Files are persisted in Supabase storage. Drizzle communicates directly with a Supabase Postgres database. This project is a work in progress.
